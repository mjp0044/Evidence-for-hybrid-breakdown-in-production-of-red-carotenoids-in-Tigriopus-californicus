R code, data files, and manuscript materials from 2021 publication in PLOS ONE

This repository contains the R code needed to replicate the analysis and recreate the figures from my 2021 article in the journal PLOS ONE.

There are 21 data files needed to import the data into the R environment using the R script. These are imported directly through the R script if saved in the same working directory as the script. 

The manuscript and supplement are also provided as the final product from the analysis. The supplement is a zip folder downloaded from Figshare containing figures and word documents.
